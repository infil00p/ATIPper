ATIPper
===============================
An interface to get around Government Fail

This is the software for a sevice where we print ATI requests, stuff them
into envelopes, and send them off for the customer.  

This was originally supposed to be a beer-money business, but I have decided to 
clean this up and open source this.  This is how I can send large volumes of ATIP
requests to government agencies to help keep them accountable.  This software
is unfinished and probably needs a ton of work before it's really useful beyond
a single user, but this makes things much easier than messing around with a PDF
on the Treasury Board's website.
